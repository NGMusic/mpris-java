# mpris-java

Simple MPRIS 2 implementation with Kotlin for Java. 
Code is mainly done, but largely untested. No guarantees for it to work.

Look into extensions/test/xerus.mpris.MPRISPlayer for a test implementation.

It has two modules, the project itself and mpris-extensions, 
which is meant to ease the use of this library by providing reference 
implementations and abstractions.
